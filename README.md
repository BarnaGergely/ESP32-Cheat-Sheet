ESP32 Cheat Sheet
===================

This is a page- or poster-sized cheat sheet for ESP32 programmers.  It draws primarily from the [Arduino Language Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/), including most of the common, basic syntax and a variety of the built-in functions.

</p>

It is based on a [cheat sheet by Mark Liffiton](https://github.com/liffiton/Arduino-Cheat-Sheet).  Additionally, the ESP32 board drawing is adapted from an Arduino board drawing in [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) (under a CC-BY-SA license).

Please let me know if you find any errors -- Thanks!
